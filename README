🎬 Hybrid Recommender System

This project implements a Hybrid Recommendation System that combines User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering to generate accurate and personalized movie recommendations.

The system produces 10 recommendations per user:

5 from user-based similarity

5 from item-based similarity

🔍 Problem Definition

Single recommendation approaches often have limitations:

User-based methods capture behavioral similarity but can be unstable

Item-based methods are more stable but less personalized

To overcome this, a hybrid approach is used to balance:

User behavior

Item similarity

🧠 Methodology
User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Filters out rarely rated movies to reduce noise

Identifies users who watched at least 60% of the same movies

Uses Pearson correlation to measure user similarity

Applies weighted average ratings for recommendations

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Selects the most recently watched movie rated 5 stars

Computes similarity between movies using correlation

Recommends the most similar items

📊 Output

5 user-based recommendations

5 item-based recommendations

Final hybrid list of 10 personalized movie suggestions
