Project Summary – Hybrid Recommender System

In this project, I built a Hybrid Recommender System that combines User-Based and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering to generate more accurate and balanced movie recommendations. For a given user, the system produces 10 recommendations in total:

5 from a user-based model

5 from an item-based model

The goal was to leverage the strengths of both approaches while minimizing their individual limitations.

🔹 Why a Hybrid Model?

Using a single recommendation technique can be limiting:

User-based collaborative filtering is strong at capturing behavioral similarity between users.

Item-based collaborative filtering is more stable and effective at finding items similar to those the user already likes.

By combining both, I aimed to:

Capture collective user behavior

While also respecting individual content preferences

This results in more reliable and relevant recommendations.

🔹 How the User-Based Model Works

I first prepared the data by removing movies with fewer than 1,000 ratings to reduce noise.

I created a user–movie rating matrix.

For the target user, I identified all movies they had rated.

I selected users who had watched at least 60% of the same movies, treating them as similar users.

I calculated Pearson correlation between users to measure similarity.

I weighted each neighbor’s ratings by their correlation score to compute a
Weighted Average Recommendation Score.

Based on this score, I generated the top 5 movie recommendations.

👉 This approach answers the question:
“What did users with very similar viewing behavior like?”

🔹 How the Item-Based Model Works

I selected the movie that the user:

Rated 5 stars

And watched most recently

Using the user–movie matrix, I calculated correlations between this movie and all other movies.

I ranked movies based on similarity scores.

Excluding the movie itself, I recommended the top 5 most similar movies.

👉 This approach answers the question:
“If the user loved this movie, what other movies are most similar to it?”
